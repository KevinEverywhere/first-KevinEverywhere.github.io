			<h1>Lesson 1: Overview</h1>
			<div class="inner_content">
				<p>
					bob-angular is an ambitious tool for learning a number of current technologies and techniques through functional examples. Rather than focus on a single application or framework, bob-angular looks at the interconnectedness of the many moving parts in a modern web application. To do this, it includes an express server and postgres database, as well as a fully functional angular application.
				</p>
			</div>
			<h2>Initial Concept</h2>
			<div class="inner_content">
				<p>
					In creating this seed, I wanted to acquire new knowledge, apply existing knowledge to something that could capture my imagination, and give enough dimension and thought to it to make it useful to others. As a matter of purpose, design choices were made to include:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>a rich single page app run on top of angular</li>
					<li>a modern server side component built on top of node</li>
					<li>a development and build process that included modern automation and testing</li>
					<li>a demonstration of traditional 2d web content mapped to animating 3d surfaces</li>
					<li>methods to provide javascript as well as css support to responsive design</li>
					<li>a youtube feed component</li>
					<li>an open source mapping component</li>
					<li>an svg interactive map of the world</li>
					<li>a functioning server and sample database integration</li>
					<li>a method to push builds to github and then heroku</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Most of the larger objectives were included at the outset, but as development began, new ones were identified and included as possible. At the end of this initial rev, there are known (and unknown) anomalous functionalities that will want to be improved, but there is at least enough to sink one's teeth in without worry of acquiring too bad a taste from its implementation.
				</p>
			</div>
			<h2>Technology Choices</h2>
			<div class="inner_content">
				<p>
					The following client and server technologies, libraries and frameworks have been used in the creation of bob-angular.
				</p>
				<h3>Client technologies</h3>
					<ul>

						<li>html5, css3 and javascript</li>
						<li><a href="http://angularjs.org">angular.js</a></li>

					<li><a href="http://www.heroku.com/">heroku</a></li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					As much as possible, attempts were made to create structures and make code and process choices that would enable late-conceived features to be included without impacting the overall application. The introduction will conclude with a brief description of the application's file and directory structure.
				</p>
				<h2>File and Directory Structure</h2>
				<p>
					In the outermost directory, there are five sub directories and nine files for installation and server tasks. The client application is built during the installation process and is a child of the "dist" directory.
				</p>

	app/                                   --> application source files

	  libs/                                --> repository for bower-created 
	    3l, angular, bootstrap, three.js,      source files from 'npm start' or  
	    jquery, less, ui-router, others        'bower install' 
	  app.js                               --> main application module
	  index.html                           --> the entrace point to the app.

	dist/                                  --> grunt-created after bower install

	*****   IMPORTANT!     *****           --> dist contains compiled app/ files

	node_modules/                          --> created for server use during install
	tests/                                 --> supporting files for tests 
	tests/e2e-tests/                       --> end-to-end tests
	.bowerrc                               --> directs bower to load libs
	.gitignore                             --> the files that are excluded for git
	bower.json                             --> client-side libraries to install
	exports.index.js                       --> express server for testing
	Gruntfile.js                           --> Creates the files that go in dist
	index.js                               --> express server and postgres gateway
	karma.conf.js                          --> config file for karma unit tests 
	package.json                           --> instruction files for npm 
	Procfile                               --> runs _node index.js_ on heroku

					In the next lesson, the main installation files, including package.json, bower.json, and Gruntfile, will be explored.
