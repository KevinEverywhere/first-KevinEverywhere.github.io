						<p>
							There were a number of frameworks available to choose at project launch. As well as angular, backbone, ember, knockout and others, there were also the options of not using a framework, or creating one specifically for project needs. This document gives the reasons that anguar was selected over other options, and the rationale behind its architecture.

					<h2>Routing and the Impact of Choices</h2>

						<p>
							One of the most important decisions to make in building a web application is how the routing will be managed. There are a variety of server and client methods to maintain state that enable single page development. The choice that I made here was one that was influenced by my desire to have multiple screen elements change based on the application's state. In hindsight, I believe that I could have done this better by not using the ui.router module, in favor of a dynamic directive.
