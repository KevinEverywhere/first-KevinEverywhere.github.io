          These days, it is not enough to say that you know JavaScript or client-server or object-oriented development. Developers are increasingly being pushed to become familiar with each layer in multitier development. Not being familiar with one tier or another may cost you that interview that you had been waiting to find, and the dream job that follows. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The bob-angular seed is a ready-to-deploy, full stack node application with an express server, postgres database, and independent angular front end. It is intended to be poked at and learned from, and is not claimed to be the best way to do or solve any specific issue that is resolved with the code it contains. It is imperfect, but works.
        </p>
        <h2>Who This is For</h2>
        <p>
          This is intended for those learning angular, node, full-stack javascript development, automating builds through github and heroku, three.js, d3.js and svg skills, applying less stylesheets, creating REST urls, creating unit and e2e tests, integrating the Leaflet map and YouTube video search APIs into an application. Basically, this is intended to be an app in which everything works, not always as polished as your application will, but there is enough to help someone through a situation that requires proof through application. 
        </p>
        <h2>What this is and is not</h2>
        <p>
          This is a fully functioning application, with an express server, a client-side angular-based seed application, with unit and end to end tests. It is not necessarily representative of best practices in any of its constituent elements. It is guaranteed to work as is. 
        </p>
        <h3>Skills You will Acquire</h3>
        <h4>Application: Server and Testing</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Use node and the node package manager (npm) to install and build deployable app</li>
          <li>Build a package.json script that enables node server development and deployment</li>
          <li>Build a bower.json script that enables angular application development and deployment</li>
          <li>Write a Gruntfile that uses the package and bower scripts to create deployable app</li>
          <li>Create karma unit tests in Jasmine</li>
          <li>Create end to end (e2e) tests in Jasmine for protractor</li>
          <li>Postgres querying from Node</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Application: Client and Client-Server</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Develop a complex angular application</li>
          <li>Use three.js to enable the mapping of 2d content to 3d placememnt</li>
          <li>Integrate a number of APIs and Technologies with angular and three including
            <ul>
              <li>Bootstrap, because you already use it</li>
              <li>JQuery, used sparingly</li>
              <li>Less and Responsive Stylesheets</li>
              <li>YouTube, with a video search feed</li>
              <li>Leaflet (mobile friendly mapping)</li>
              <li>SVG and WebGL, mixing DOM with Canvas</li>
              <li>D3, tying together data and presentation</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Asynchronous Loading from angular, jquery, d3 and other frameworks</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          And, as a bonus, the grouped_world.svg file uses ISO2 country labels (such as fr for France), grouped within continent shapes. This enables the map to be useful as both an interactive controller and an addressable display element.
        </p>
        <p>
          Much of what you will see will be built into the code itself, such as using jQuery or D3 selector methods, or bootstrap css classes. The most interesting element in the application, for me, is how the three.js components replace a DOM element; then children or siblings of that DOM element, which were never in the visible DOM, are inserted into the three.js component. This enables the full interactivity of 2D Web to be mapped onto WebGL shapes at up to 60 frames per second (fps). The image display is GPU-powered, which means that the device will determine the suitable fps. Several interactive examples, including a YouTube player with feed, a Leaflet location finder, and an SVG map of the world which uses World Bank JSON files to demonstrate D3-SVG statistical display, are included.
