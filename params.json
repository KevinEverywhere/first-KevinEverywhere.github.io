{"name":"bob-angular","tagline":"An evolving angular-three.js seed","body":"###version 0.0.0\r\n\r\n*This is in development and is not recommended to develop with as a base until version 0.0.1.*\r\n\r\nThis project is an application skeleton, influenced by and forked from angular-seed,\r\n[https://github.com/angular/angular-seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed)\r\nIt provides a Three D metaphor with sample page and use scenarios.\r\n\r\nThe application is preconfigured to install the Angular framework, three.js, d3, less,\r\nand required third-party frameworks. The seed app provides navigation and transition \r\nfunctionality, API-powered 3D content panes, as well as development and testing tools.\r\n\r\n### Prerequisites\r\n\r\nYou must have node.js and its package manager (npm) installed. All other dependencies\r\nare managed by node through package.json, and then bower thrugh bower.json. You can \r\nget node and npm from [http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/).\r\n\r\n### Clone bob-angular\r\n\r\nIn the terminal, in the directory where you want to install the app, git clone the \r\nbob-angular repository. Then, run *npm start* to install and launch the node \r\nweb server; or *npm install* and *bower install* to merely install the application\r\ndependencies. \r\n\r\n*Permission issues may occur if the directory permission and user permissions are different.*\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/KevinEverywhere/bob-angular.git\r\ncd bob-angular\r\nnpm start \r\n```\r\n\r\n### Install Dependencies\r\n\r\nThere are server-side, application and testing dependencies loaded in  `npm`, \r\nthe [node package manager][npm], and in the front-end development dependencies\r\nthrough `bower`, a [client-side code package manager][bower].\r\n\r\nThe npm install and npm start scripts will install two new directories, \r\nand then populate them with imported code:\r\n\r\n* `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the tools we need\r\n* `app/libs` - contains the angular framework files\r\n\r\n*The `libs` folder is put into the app folder  through the `.bowerrc` file when \r\n'bower install' is run.\r\n\r\n### Run the Application\r\n\r\nThe application can be tested in localhost:8000 by running npm start\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm start\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe app should now be running at `http://localhost:8000/app/`. The most typical\r\nproblems in npm start involve permission issues, availability of port, and \r\nsoftware availability. Ensure that you have the correct software installed to begin, \r\nand that the directory in which you are running npm start contains the bob-angular \r\nseed files. \r\n\r\n####Port 8000 Availability\r\n\r\nEdit line 23 of package.json so that the 8000 port is changed to the one you wish\r\nto use.\r\n\r\n```\r\n    \"start\": \"http-server -a localhost -p 8000 -c-1\",\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Directory Layout\r\n\r\n```\r\napp/                                   --> all of the source files for the application\r\n  assets/                              --> asset and creation media, CSS JS, JSON files\r\n    css, js, media\r\n  components/                          --> view or feature based components\r\n    footer, main, media, navigation    --> view components\r\n    youtube, leaflet                   --> feature (vendor) based components\r\n  shared/                              --> feature based shared components (services)\r\n    three_module                       --> angular three service used by view pontts \r\n  libs/                                --> the repository for bower installed JS files\r\n    3l, angular, bootstrap, three.js,  --> bower-maintained source files created after\r\n    jquery, less, ui-router, others        running 'npm start' or 'bower install' \r\n  app.js                               --> main application module\r\n  index.html                           --> the entrace point to the app.\r\nTODO:\r\n  index-async.html                     --> index.html with asynchronous JavaScript loads\r\nkarma.conf.js                          --> config file for running unit tests with Karma\r\ne2e-tests/                             --> end-to-end tests\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nThere will be two kinds of tests in the bob-angular seed application: Unit tests and End to End tests.\r\n\r\nThis section will be expanded as the content is updated and made available for view and testing.\r\n\r\n## Contact\r\n\r\nFor more information on bob-angular please contact kevin@planetkevin.com\r\n\r\n[angular]: http://angularjs.org/\r\n[git]: http://git-scm.com/\r\n[bower]: http://bower.io\r\n[npm]: https://www.npmjs.org/\r\n[node]: http://nodejs.org\r\n[less]: http://lesscss.org/\r\n[leaflet]:http://leafletjs.com/\r\n[protractor]: https://github.com/angular/protractor\r\n[jasmine]: http://jasmine.github.io\r\n[karma]: http://karma-runner.github.io\r\n[travis]: https://travis-ci.org/\r\n[http-server]: https://github.com/nodeapps/http-server\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
